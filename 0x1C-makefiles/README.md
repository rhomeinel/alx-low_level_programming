# 0x1C. C - Makefiles

- Makefiles are a simple way to organize code compilation.
- Makefiles are used to help decide which parts of a large program need to be recompiled.

## Overview of make

The make utility automatically determines which pieces of a large program need to be recompiled, and issues commands to recompile them.
